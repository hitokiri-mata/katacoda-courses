# Conclusion #

Nuclio is a new "serverless" project, derived from Iguazio's elastic data life-cycle management service for high-performance events and data processing. It is also an emerging serverless solution for Kubernetes.

## Lessons Learned ##

With these steps you have learned:

- how to install Nuclio on Kubernetes,
- how functions are deployed and removed,
- how functions are named, exposed, and invoked,
- how functions are listed, inspected and monitored.
