You have learned the majority of the features of Helm. The harder part is creating charts with various dependencies and deployed to a variety of Kubernetes targets with varying contexts. Hopefully, though, you should have the fundamentals to get started.

More details can be found in the [Helm documentation](http://www.helm.sh/).

There are a few more important features that this scenario did not cover. Helm charts are testable with the [_test_](https://docs.helm.sh/helm/helm_test/) command. Helm charts can be [packaged](https://docs.helm.sh/helm/#helm-package), versioned and deployed to a chart archive/registry. The Helm tool has a community of [plugins](https://docs.helm.sh/helm/#helm-plugin-list) to extend its functionality.

## Lessons Learned ##

With these steps you have learned:

- How to install and uninstall applications,
- What a chart provides,
- How to list public charts,
- How to list and add more repositories,
- How to create your own chart,
- How to update a chart.
